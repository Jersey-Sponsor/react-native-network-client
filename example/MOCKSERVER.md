# Mock Server

### How to run Mockserver
1. [Install Mockserver](https://github.com/namshi/mockserver#installation).
```
npm install -g mockserver
```
2. Run Mockserver
```
npm run mockserver
```
3. Verify Mockserver is running: `http://localhost:8080`.

### How to create mocks
[Mock files](https://github.com/namshi/mockserver#mock-files) follow this convention based on the response that they are going to serve:
```
$REQUEST-PATH/$HTTP-METHOD.mock
```

As an example, the mock file for a GET request URL `http://localhost:8080/get` needs to correspond to the file path `mocks/get/GET.mock`. See current folder structure:
- mocks
   - delete
       - DELETE.mock
   - get
       - GET.mock
   - patch
       - PATCH.mock
   - post
       - POST.mock
   - put
       - PUT.mock
