# Example Application

### iOS local setup
1. Install [applesimutils](https://github.com/wix/AppleSimulatorUtils):
```
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils
```
2. Set XCode’s build location so that the built app, especially debug, is expected at the project’s location instead of the Library’s folder which is unique/hashed.
3. Open XCode, then go to **XCode > Preferences > Locations**.
4. Under **Derived Data**, click **Advanced…**.
5. Select **Custom > Relative to Workspace**, then set **Products** as **Build/Products**.
6. Click **Done** to save the changes.

### Android local setup
1. Install the latest Android SDK.
```
sdkmanager "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86"
sdkmanager --licenses
```
2. Create the emulator using `npm run e2e:android-create-emulator` from the `/detox` folder. Android testing requires an emulator named `detox_emu_api_30` and the script helps to create it automatically.

### How to install the example application
1. Clean install node modules for the example application.
```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```
2. Install the example application to simulator/emulator device.
iOS,
```
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
npm run ios
```
Android,
```
npm run android
```

### How to run Detox E2E tests against the example application
1. Run the mock server. Follow instructions at [How to run Mockserver](MOCKSERVER.md#how-to-run-mockserver).
**Important:** Detox tests require that the mockserver is running. If mockserver is not running, the test will launch one.
2. Clean install node modules for detox.
```
cd detox
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
cd ..
```
3. Launch the simulator/emulator device where the example application is installed, then start the react packager/server.
```
npm run start
```
4. Run detox tests.
iOS,
```
cd detox
npm run e2e:ios-test
```
Android,
```
cd detox
npm run e2e:android-build
npm run e2e:android-test
```
5. To run a specific test file, append the path to the test file like in the example below,
```
npm run e2e:ios-test -- e2e/test/get/get_generic_client_request.e2e.js
```

For more detailed information on Detox, please visit the official [Detox Documentation](https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/master/docs/README.md).

Note: Before running tests, toggle off smart punctuation to disable smart quotes on device. For iOS, go to *Settings > General > Keyboard*, and toggle off **Smart Punctuation**.
